This is a H.261 encoder, see http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=1088.

The code can be compiled using gcc and many more plain old C compilers.

The code is written for readability and follows the H.261 standard. It is not optimized.

Raw YUV420p video in CIF (352 x 288) for input is found on https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/ 

Conversion from .y4m to .yuv was done using `ffmpeg -i football_cif.y4m football_cif.yuv`.
